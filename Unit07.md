**Unit 7: The Impact of Regional, Sectarian, and Tribal Conflicts on US
National Security** <span id="7"></span> 
*The horrors inflicted by World War II has led the United States in
recent decades to assume a leadership role, or as some would say the
role of world’s policeman, in preventing war and atrocities. While US
military intervention and occupation in Germany, Korea, and Japan have
been successful, many other efforts to stabilize and develop war-torn
regions have not. In the post-Cold War era, American policy towards
peacekeeping and developmental aid as a means of promoting national
security has become less focused, with the exception of Iraq and
Afghanistan.    *  
    
 *The history of colonial interests throughout much of the third world
hampered the development of indigenous industry and governance,
particularly in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Many modern day
countries have boundaries that are not based on common interests or
cultures, but rather, artificially created boundaries drawn by former
colonial masters. As a result, tribal or sectarian strife is rampant
within many borders. The borders of Afghanistan, for example, were
created with the drawing of the Durand Line along the country’s border
with Pakistan. The Durand Line effectively split the Pashtuns between
the two countries. This was done to keep the Pashtuns from becoming too
powerful. The long-term result is that there are large numbers of
Pashtuns in each country who are disaffected and loyal to neither
nation, but rather, only loyal to the Pashtun tribe and the longed-for
country of Pashtunistan. It was no accident that Osama bin Laden and the
leaders of the Taliban and al Qaeda fled Afghanistan in 2001 for the
hills of Northwest Pakistan; they knew that the Pashtuns in the area
would feel loyalty towards neither the Afghan nor the Pakistani
governments.   *  
    
 *Large-scale atrocities have occurred in places like Cambodia, Laos,
Vietnam, North Korea, Sudan, Rwanda, Somalia, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan,
Pakistan, and Bosnia in the past three decades. Prior to the deployment
of US resources and personnel, national security policymakers and
leaders should consider the impact and consequences of such actions.
Policymakers consider questions like: What national security interests
would justify the US embarking on such missions? What protection do such
forces have in terms of immunity, status of forces agreements, etc.? Can
the deployment be sold to and supported by the American people, i.e.,
are they willing to risk the lives of their loved ones serving in the
military and/or increased national debt or tax liability for the goals
of the operation? What would we accomplish by acting? What would we risk
by failing to act? *

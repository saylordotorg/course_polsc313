**Unit 3: The Role of Congress in US National Security** <span
id="3"></span> 
*While the US Constitution specifically gives Congress the power to
declare war, raise armies, and ratify treaties, the increasing
complexity of international relations and military operations seem to
have led to a reduced role for Congress in national security than that
which was enjoyed at the time of the nation’s founding. Political
agendas and personal ambitions of members also create dissent both
within Congress and between the legislative and executive branches,
whereas key officials in the executive branch—who serve at the pleasure
of the president and can be fired should their performance or policies
conflict with those of the administration, members of Congress,
particularly the leadership—have no such authority over their
subordinates. The worst that a House or Senate leader can do to a
dissenting member of their party is to demote them from key committees
or withhold party-based funding for re-election campaigns; they cannot
fire them in the same manner as the president would do to a member of
the executive branch who bucked policy goals and implementation
thereof.*  
  
 *Intelligence and national security operations generally fall within
the purview of the executive branch; however, Congress has oversight
powers over the military, the intelligence agencies, and the State
Department, inter alia. Congress also has a veto power of sorts over
military deployments via the War Powers Act of 1973 and controls the
budgets of each. The judicial branch generally defers to the other
branches in the realm of intelligence and national security operations,
citing the* political questions*doctrine, except where there are
significant personal liberty issues under the US Constitution (i.e., the
right to the free exercise of religion by members of the US military) or
when the other branches try to exercise judicial authority (i.e.,
military tribunals at Guantanamo Bay or the Uniform Code of Military
Justice). Key positions within each department and agency are subject to
consent by the Senate. These powers give Congress some reactive
authority but not much proactive authority or direct involvement in
policymaking and implementation.*  
  
 *Both the House and the Senate have Select Committees on Intelligence
to review matters pertaining to covert and/or classified operations
pertaining to national security. The Intelligence Oversight Act of 1980
contains provisions for reporting clandestine activities to the Select
Committees for oversight. Congress also controls the purse strings for
departments running such operations and has used the strategy of denying
or threatening to curtail operational funding as a means of interjecting
policy changes. *

**Unit 5: The Processes of Policy Analysis and Policymaking Related to
US National Security** <span id="5"></span> 
*The* policy triad*to the president on issues of national security
consists of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the
National Security Advisor. The Secretary of State is the president’s
principal advisor on diplomacy and foreign affairs as well as
supervising the work of ambassadors and State Department personnel.
Whereas the military is primarily organized per region, the line and
file members of the State Department are organized by specialization and
operational function.*  
    
 *The National Security Advisor leads the National Security Council
(NSC). Members of the National Security Council include the president,
the vice president, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State,
the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of the
Central Intelligence Agency. The National Security Council is composed
of political appointees, who serve at the pleasure of the president. The
relatively small number of persons on the NSC and the use of political
appointees as staff are meant to speed up deliberation, particularly in
times of crisis, in which difficult decisions involving defense of the
nation must be made and implemented quickly.*

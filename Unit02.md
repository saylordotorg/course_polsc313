**Unit 2: The Roles of the President and the Executive Branch in US
National Security** <span id="2"></span> 
*Article II, section 2 of the US Constitution designates the president
as commander-in-chief. In contemporary times, Congress and the courts
have given great deference to the president and executive branch in
areas concerning defense, foreign policy, and national security. The
president’s powers in these areas are not absolute nor have they always
been as strong as they have been in recent years.*  
  
 *The president’s exercise of power in matters related to US national
security has evolved greatly since the time of our founding fathers. The
system of checks and balances within the federal government was designed
to naturally pit the ambitions of actors within each branch against the
ambitions of actors in the other branches. One of the most pressing
concerns of the Constitution’s framers was the capacity to wage war;
they sought to prevent the ability of the president to rush into war and
to generally make the entry into any war more difficult by the division
of military powers between the executive and legislative branches.*

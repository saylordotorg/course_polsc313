**Unit 4: The Role of the Military, Homeland Security, and Intelligence
Agencies in US National Security** <span id="4"></span> 
*The military and intelligence agencies are the operational arms of the
national security establishment. The military chain of command is led by
the president, who serves as commander-in-chief, followed by the
Secretary of Defense, who is the civilian leader of the armed forces,
and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is the top leader in
the military. Under the 1986 Defense Reorganization Act, military forces
are organized into geographic and functional commands. Regular forces
fall under geographical commands, and specialized units are grouped
under the Joint Forces Command, Special Forces Command, Strategic
Command, and Transportation Command.*  
  
 *Following the end of the Cold War, President Clinton began downsizing
the components of the military. Troop numbers overall were reduced and
many support positions in transportation, logistics, and dining and
residential facilities that were previously filled by active duty forces
were filled by civilian contractors. After 9/11, the numbers of both
active duty forces and civilian contractors increased, but this still
was not enough to avoid mass recalls of reservists and National
Guardsmen to active duty for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. *  
    
 *The events of 9/11 revealed gaps in communication and data sharing
between intelligence agencies and law enforcement authorities. Several
agencies, particularly the FBI and the National Security Agency, had
pieces of information concerning planning and implementation of the
attacks but were unaware of info possessed by outside agencies that
could have led to actionable intelligence. Actionable intelligence is
information that is sufficiently reliable upon which to base an imminent
decision for executive or military action. The Intelligence Reform and
Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 sought to remedy these issues by
creating a Director of National Intelligence (DNI). The DNI is the chief
coordinator of intelligence activities as well as the chief intelligence
advisor to the president.*  
    
 *There are multiple types of intelligence collection. HUMINT, or Human
Intelligence, is the form of intelligence that most people think of when
they hear the term intelligence, but it is neither the only, nor the
best, form of intelligence. SIGINT, or Signals Intelligence, encompasses
the intercept and analysis of communications (COMINT), electronic
transmissions (ELINT), and seismic, acoustic, and optical intelligence
(MASINT). Access to intelligence tasking, collection platforms, data,
analysis, and reporting is controlled by level of security clearance and
the need to know. Limited access is in place to safeguard intelligence
collection methods as well as the information gathered. *

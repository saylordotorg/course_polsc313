**Unit 9: The Impact of Economic Strife and Conflict over Scarce
Resources on US National Security** <span id="9"></span> 
*While there is little doubt that democratic countries tend to be more
stable than non-democratic countries, there is much recent dispute about
which comes first—democracy or economic development? Recent incidents
wherein democracy has been rapidly imposed in the place of previous
authoritarian regimes, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, has caused many
political theorists to align on the side of economic development being a
necessary precursor to sustainable democracy and stable governance. When
you think in terms of basic human needs, we are all more concerned with
ensuring that we and our families have food, shelter, and basic
necessities before we worry about things like the right to vote,
representation in the government, etc.*  
    
 *Many parts of the developing world are rich in minerals, oil, natural
gas, precious metals, and other commodities of increasing value to the
developed world. As China, Russia, India, the United States, and other
developed nations seek to access these commodities, the risks of
conflict increases as the perceived supply of such commodities
decreases. Many of these resources are in unstable or failed states,
such as Sudan, Iraq, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Chad, and Nigeria. Unrest
and extreme poverty in Somalia has likewise threatened international
commerce traveling through the Gulf of Aden, as Somalian pirates attack
and hijack foreign ships in the region. These challenges have led to
some increased military and diplomatic cooperation among the developed
powers but do pose both short and long term strategic threats to the
United States, its allies, and interests. *  
    
 *Identification of these problems is far easier than agreeing upon and
implementing successful solutions. The risks of allowing such strife to
fester can unfortunately be seen in the events of 9/11. Once the Soviets
pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989, the United States largely ignored the
Afghans and their plight. The country disintegrated into civil war and
the Taliban took control of most of the country, oppressing the
citizenry, particularly women and children. While the United States and
other nations condemned such action, nothing was done to improve the
situation, as the national security interests of the United States and
its allies in Afghanistan were deemed to be minimal. Afghanistan became
a training ground for terrorists from around the world, including those
who planned and executed the attacks of 9/11. These patterns are
repeating themselves in many parts of Africa, Central Asia, and South
Asia.*

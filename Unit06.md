**Unit 6: The Impact of Nuclear, Chemical, and Biological Weapons on US
Security** <span id="6"></span> 
*For nearly five decades following World War II, the threat of nuclear
war with the USSR and/or China was considered to be the highest risk and
greatest danger to US national security. Massive build-ups of nuclear
weapons by the superpowers were believed to provide the best defense,
either through deterrence or mutually assured destruction (MAD).
Deterrence and MAD strategies were premised on the belief that the
knowledge of imminent and massive retaliation would keep other states in
check and prevent attacks. During the Reagan Administration, development
of weapons to shoot down missiles, fired either intentionally or
errantly, began. This marked a substantive shift in US strategic
thinking from a reactive to a more proactive posture.*  
    
 *The dissolution of the USSR and the thaw in relations with China, to
the extent that China is now the largest foreign holder of US government
securities, makes the risk of nuclear war with either Russia or China
less likely. Russia and the US have both destroyed large numbers of
nuclear warheads and strategic delivery systems since the end of the
Cold War. During the administration of President George W. Bush,
deployment of anti-ballistic weapons systems along the coasts of the US,
as well as abroad, was implemented primarily to protect the homeland in
the event of an accidental launch.*  
    
 *The biggest perceived threat from strategic nuclear weapons to US
national security is that posed by unstable regimes in Central Asia,
such as Pakistan, or North Korea. The risk of so-called dirty bombs,
biological weapons, or small tactical nuclear weapons falling into the
hands of terrorist groups is also a significant threat. While these
smaller nuclear, biological, or radiological weapons would not impose
the same number of immediate casualties and mass destruction as would a
strategic weapon, the impact of such a weapon would have far-reaching
consequences for commerce and security, much as did the events of
9/11. *  
    
 *Biological weapons have a much lower production cost than do nuclear,
radiological, or atomic weapons and can be fashioned from materials and
substances that are more readily available. The means of disseminating
biological pathogens are also far more varied, consisting of everything
from aerosol sprays to mortars to contamination of food, water, soil,
air, or medicine. Effective strength and range of biological weapons
varies, depending on concentration, dilution, dissipation, age, weather,
etc. Vaccinations have been and are being developed to help protect
against the pathogens contained in biological weapons, but the possible
varieties used in these weapons make total prevention of harm
impossible.*

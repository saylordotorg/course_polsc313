**Unit 1: US National Security Interests** <span id="1"></span> 
*The primary goal of the national security policies in the United States
is to protect Americans and American interests at home and abroad. The
formulation and implementation of such policies are primarily centered
in the executive branch of the federal government; however, Congress
assists in crafting legislation and policies and has both oversight and
budgetary control over the offices and agencies that play critical roles
in policy execution. Foreign policy and military affairs are the
preeminent concerns in national security, but trade, commerce, human
rights, and peaceful development are also important factors.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn to classify and prioritize national
security interests by categorizing them as vital, critical, or serious.
Vital interests relate to the immediate and imminent protection of the
homeland. Critical interests do not present an imminent or immediate
danger to the US homeland or American institutions but could be elevated
to such status if conditions were to worsen. Serious interests, on the
other hand, are neither vital nor critical to the homeland or its
survival, but nonetheless, represent a significant risk to American
economic, political, military, or humanitarian interests.*

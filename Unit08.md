**Unit 8: Terrorism and US National Security** <span id="8"></span> 
*Contrary to what pundits and politicians may say, terrorism is neither
a new, nor a 20<sup>th</sup> century phenomenon. Strategists from Sun
Tzu to Clausewitz to TE Lawrence to Mao have written about it for
centuries. Terrorism and insurgency also are not merely the result of
psychotic or fanatical ideation—many terrorists view themselves as
soldiers fighting an enemy with superior numbers and weaponry.*  
  
 *The claimed root causes of terrorism are varied, as are the strategies
used by terrorists. In assessing threats to the US by terrorist groups,
policymakers and intelligence analysts must consider a variety of
factors, including the impact that each specific group does or could
have on strategic and national security interests of both the US and its
allies.*
